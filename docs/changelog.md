## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-04

### ✨ Added
- **Dirty Control Candidates**: `workflow.py` now reuses the harshest rejected guides as "dirty controls" (see `sirnaforge/utils/control_candidates.py`) so every workflow/Nextflow run emits at least one known-bad sequence for health monitoring.

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Resilient Aggregation**: Nextflow modules (`modules/local/aggregate_results.nf`, `mirna_offtarget_analysis.nf`, `split_candidates.nf`, etc.) plus `pipeline/nextflow_cli.py` were rewritten to keep TSV/JSON artefacts in sync even when some per-genome or miRNA analyses are skipped.
- **Deterministic Cache & Defaults**: Centralized cache helpers document where transcriptome/miRNA assets live, and the CLI now enforces valid GC/length ranges with automatic transcriptome fallbacks when `--transcriptome` is omitted.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Pipeline Reliability**: Aggregation guards against missing TSVs, writes explicit workdir breadcrumbs, and standardizes BWA-MEM2 index prep plus scoped retries to eliminate intermittent Nextflow crashes.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Docs v2 Launch**: Introduced `docs_v2/` with a new Sphinx build, autogenerated CLI/API pages, and live command output so the published docs always match the Typer surface.
- **Nextflow Tutorial & Guides**: `docs/getting_started.md`, `docs/usage_examples.md`, and the expanded Nextflow tutorial now explain dirty controls, cache directories, Docker execution, and expected artefacts end-to-end.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-21

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Documentation Standardization**: Added sphinx-design tab sets across all guides so every example shows UV vs Docker commands side-by-side, reducing copy/paste errors.
- **GC Content Defaults**: Raised the default `--gc-max` to 60% (from 52%) and documented the change across CLI help and tutorials to match wet-lab guidance.
- **CI/CD Enhancements**: Release workflow now runs `test-release`, publishes coverage summaries, and properly sequences lint → test tiers for consistent PR validation.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Off-target/miRNA Search**: Fixed the regression that prevented miRNA seed matches from being emitted in combined reports when Nextflow was invoked from the CLI.
- **Docker Test Environment**: Updated `make docker-test` docs and scripts to avoid `uv sync` conflicts inside the container image.

### 🧪 Testing
- **Test Tier Documentation**: `make test-release` now produces a single narrative across dev/ci/release markers with expected run times and coverage outputs, making it easier for contributors to reproduce CI locally.

### 📦 Build & Infrastructure
- **Make Targets**: Documented the revamped `test-dev`, `test-ci`, and `test-release` targets along with their coverage/JUnit outputs so users know which tier to run before opening a PR.
