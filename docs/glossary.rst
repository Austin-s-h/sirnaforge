   siRNA
      Small interfering RNA. Short double-stranded RNA molecules that can silence gene expression through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.

   Off-target
      Unintended binding of siRNA to mRNA sequences other than the intended target, which can cause unwanted gene silencing.

   Thermodynamics
      The study of energy changes in RNA folding and hybridization, crucial for predicting siRNA stability and effectiveness.

   Thermodynamic Asymmetry
      The stability difference between the 5' and 3' ends of an siRNA duplex. Proper asymmetry (less stable 5' end on guide strand) promotes correct guide strand selection into RISC. Based on research by Khvorova et al. (2003) and others showing this is critical for siRNA functionality.

   Asymmetry Score
      A numerical measure (0-1) of thermodynamic asymmetry in siRNA duplexes. Higher scores indicate better asymmetry for guide strand incorporation into RISC. Calculated from the free energy difference between duplex ends.

   Paired Fraction
      The fraction of nucleotides in the siRNA guide strand that are paired with the passenger strand in the predicted secondary structure. Values of 0.5-0.7 are optimal for effective RISC loading.

   MFE
      Minimum Free Energy. The free energy of the most stable RNA secondary structure. Optimal values for siRNA are -2 to -8 kcal/mol for effective RISC processing.

   Duplex Stability
      The total free energy change (ΔG) for siRNA duplex formation, measured in kcal/mol. Optimal range is -15 to -25 kcal/mol for balanced stability and RISC loading.

   Delta DG End
      The difference in stability between the 3' and 5' ends of the siRNA duplex (ΔG₃' - ΔG₅'). Positive values (+2 to +6 kcal/mol) indicate proper asymmetry for guide strand selection.

   RISC
      RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. The protein complex that incorporates siRNA and uses it to cleave complementary mRNA.

   Guide strand
      The strand of siRNA that is incorporated into RISC and guides target recognition.

   Passenger strand
      The strand of siRNA that is typically degraded during RISC loading.

   Seed region
      Nucleotides 2-8 of the siRNA guide strand, critical for target recognition.

   ORF
      Open Reading Frame. A sequence of DNA or RNA that can be translated into protein.

   GC content
      The percentage of guanine and cytosine nucleotides in a sequence, affecting stability.

   Tm
      Melting temperature. The temperature at which half of RNA duplexes dissociate.

   Vienna RNA
      Software package for RNA secondary structure prediction and thermodynamic analysis.

   NCBI
      National Center for Biotechnology Information. Database of genetic sequences.

   Ensembl
      Genome database project providing gene annotations and comparative genomics.

   Nextflow
      Workflow management system for computational pipelines.

   BLAST
      Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for sequence similarity searches.
