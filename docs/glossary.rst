   siRNA
      Small interfering RNA. Short double-stranded RNA molecules that can silence gene expression through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.

   Off-target
      Unintended binding of siRNA to mRNA sequences other than the intended target, which can cause unwanted gene silencing.

   Thermodynamics
      The study of energy changes in RNA folding and hybridization, crucial for predicting siRNA stability and effectiveness.

   RISC
      RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. The protein complex that incorporates siRNA and uses it to cleave complementary mRNA.

   Guide strand
      The strand of siRNA that is incorporated into RISC and guides target recognition.

   Passenger strand
      The strand of siRNA that is typically degraded during RISC loading.

   Seed region  
      Nucleotides 2-8 of the siRNA guide strand, critical for target recognition.

   ORF
      Open Reading Frame. A sequence of DNA or RNA that can be translated into protein.

   GC content
      The percentage of guanine and cytosine nucleotides in a sequence, affecting stability.

   Tm
      Melting temperature. The temperature at which half of RNA duplexes dissociate.

   Vienna RNA
      Software package for RNA secondary structure prediction and thermodynamic analysis.

   NCBI
      National Center for Biotechnology Information. Database of genetic sequences.

   Ensembl
      Genome database project providing gene annotations and comparative genomics.

   Nextflow
      Workflow management system for computational pipelines.

   BLAST
      Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for sequence similarity searches.
