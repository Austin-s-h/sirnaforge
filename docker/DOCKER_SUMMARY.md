# Docker-First Infrastructure Summary

## What We've Built

### 🐳 Comprehensive Docker Image
- **Single image** contains everything: Python, bioinformatics tools, Nextflow, AWS CLI
- **Uses conda environment** - `docker/environment.yml` for reproducible tool versions
- **Micromamba-based** - Fast, lightweight package management
- **No external dependencies** - everything works out of the box
- **Consistent environment** - same results everywhere (local, cloud, HPC)

### 📋 Key Components Included
1. **Python Environment**: siRNAforge + all Python dependencies via uv
2. **Workflow Management**: Nextflow 25.04+ with modern features and Java 17
3. **Bioinformatics Tools**: BWA-MEM2, SAMtools, ViennaRNA (exact versions)
4. **Cloud Integration**: AWS CLI for S3 genome downloads
5. **Utilities**: jq, pigz, compression tools
6. **Linting Support**: Nextflow lint integrated into development workflow

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run (uses docker/environment.yml for tool versions)
make docker-build
make docker-workflow GENE=TP53

# Or directly
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t sirnaforge:latest .
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace sirnaforge:latest \
    sirnaforge workflow TP53 --output-dir results
```

#### Production Deployments
- **AWS Batch**: Push image to ECR, configure Nextflow
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy as Jobs or CronJobs
- **HPC/SLURM**: Convert to Apptainer for SLURM integration

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Docker-first quick start
- **docs/deployment.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide focused on Docker
- **pyproject.toml**: Nextflow 25+ as pipeline dependency with linting support
- **Makefile**: Docker build and Nextflow development targets
- **docker-compose.yml**: Development environment setup
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Nextflow linting in pre-commit hooks

### 🎯 Benefits
1. **Simplified Deployment**: One image, all dependencies
2. **Reproducible Results**: Same environment everywhere
3. **Easy Scaling**: Works with any container orchestrator
4. **Developer Friendly**: Local development matches production
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Perfect for automated pipelines
