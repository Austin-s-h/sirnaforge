## 🧬 What is siRNAforge?

**siRNAforge** is a production-ready tool for designing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with integrated multi-species off-target analysis. Built for researchers who need reliable, high-specificity gene silencing candidates.

### Why siRNAforge?

- 🎯 **End-to-end workflow** — From gene symbol to ranked candidates in one command
- 🔬 **Multi-species validation** — Off-target analysis of transcriptome and miRNA seed matches across human, rat, and rhesus macaque genomes
- 🐍 **Developer-friendly** — Modern Python API with full type hints and Pydantic models. Easily extend with your own scoring methods.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🔍 Multi-database search** | Automatic transcript retrieval from Ensembl, RefSeq (TODO), and GENCODE (TODO) |
| **🌡️ Thermodynamic scoring** | ViennaRNA-based secondary structure prediction and stability analysis |
| **🎯 Transcriptome Off-target analysis** | Transcriptome BWA-MEM2 `transcriptome` search with mismatch tolerance control |
| **🧬 miRNA seed avoidance** | MirGeneDB, MirBase (TODO) BWA-MEM2 `mirna_seed` search for known matches to miRNA seed regions |
| **🔤 Smart species handling** | Accepts any format (common names, miRBase codes, scientific names) — auto-normalizes to canonical |
| **⚙️ Nextflow pipeline** | Scalable, containerized execution for high-throughput analysis |
| **💉 Chemical modifications** | Track 2'-O-methyl, 2'-fluoro, and phosphorothioate patterns |
| **📊 Rich output** | Structured CSV, FASTA, and JSON reports with comprehensive metadata |

**Supported Python versions:** 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 *(Python 3.13+ pending ViennaRNA compatibility)*

## 📦 Installation

Choose your path based on what you need to do:

 **[Complete installation guide with troubleshooting →](docs/getting_started.md)**

- **Deploy / run from registry (no setup)** — Pull the prebuilt image with all bio tools, Nextflow, and Java bundled.
  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/austin-s-h/sirnaforge:latest
  ```

- **Daily development (Python-only, fast)** — Use uv + managed virtualenv; great for core code and unit tests. Heavy bio/Nextflow tests stay skipped unless you also have Docker/Java.
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  git clone https://github.com/austin-s-h/sirnaforge && cd sirnaforge
  uv sync --dev
  make dev
  make check
  ```

- **Complete local testing (matches CI)** — Either
  1) Build and test in Docker (reuses the bundled tools): `make docker-build-test`
  2) Or use conda to get bio deps + Java locally, then run the full suite:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
  conda activate sirnaforge
  make test-release
  ```
  (Nextflow/Java are required for Nextflow-marked tests; Docker is required for container-marked tests.)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your first results in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Docker
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace \
  ghcr.io/austin-s-h/sirnaforge:latest \
  sirnaforge workflow TP53 --output-dir results

# Local
uv run sirnaforge workflow TP53 --output-dir results
```

**What you get:**
- Transcript sequences from Ensembl
- Thermodynamically-scored siRNA candidates
- Off-target analysis (Docker only)
- Ranked results in CSV and FASTA formats
- Automatic Ensembl transcriptome indexing across human, mouse, rat, and rhesus macaque (override with `--transcriptome-fasta`, or supply design-ready transcripts via `--input-fasta`)
- A `reference_summary` block in `logs/workflow_summary.json` that records whether each reference was explicit, defaulted, or disabled

Need more control? Customize with parameters:

```bash
sirnaforge workflow BRCA1 \
  --genome-species "human,rat,rhesus" \
  --gc-min 40 --gc-max 60 \
  --top-n 50 \
  --design-mode mirna \
  --output-dir results
```

### Custom inputs & offline mode

Bring your own transcript sequences while still running the full workflow:

```bash
# Design from bundled sample FASTA (design-only mode, no transcriptome off-target)
sirnaforge workflow TP53 \
  --input-fasta examples/sample_transcripts.fasta \
  --output-dir custom_inputs_demo

# Design from bundled sample FASTA and align against mouse transcriptome
sirnaforge workflow TP53 \
  --input-fasta examples/sample_transcripts.fasta \
  --transcriptome-fasta ensembl_mouse_cdna \
  --output-dir custom_inputs_demo

# Remote FASTA sources also work
sirnaforge workflow BRCA1 \
  --input-fasta https://example.org/custom/brca1.fasta \
  --transcriptome-fasta /data/reference/ensembl_human_cdna_111.fasta
```

`--input-fasta` skips the gene search stage and designs directly from your sequences. When used alone, transcriptome off-target analysis is disabled (design-only mode). To enable transcriptome off-target with custom inputs, explicitly provide `--transcriptome-fasta`.

When `--transcriptome-fasta` is omitted the workflow automatically indexes the bundled Ensembl cDNA transcriptomes for human, mouse, rat, and macaque so multi-species off-target analysis runs out of the box.

Every workflow run now captures the resolved transcriptome decision in `logs/workflow_summary.json` under `reference_summary.transcriptome`, indicating whether the reference was auto-selected, explicitly supplied, or intentionally disabled. This makes it easier to audit production runs and confirm that default references were applied as expected.

## 🎯 Use Cases

**🧬 Basic Gene Silencing**
```bash
sirnaforge workflow EGFR --output-dir egfr_analysis
```
Design siRNAs for a single target gene with default parameters.

**🔬 Multi-Species Validation**
```bash
# Accepts any species format - auto-normalizes to canonical names
sirnaforge workflow TP53 --species "human,rat,macaque"
# Also works: --species "hsa,rno,mml" or --species "Homo sapiens,Rattus norvegicus,Macaca mulatta"
```
Check off-target potential across multiple model organisms.

**🧪 miRNA Seed Avoidance**
```bash
# Species parameter drives both transcriptome and miRNA analysis
sirnaforge workflow BRCA1 --species "human,mouse"
# Override miRNA species independently if needed: --mirna-species "hsa,mmu,rno"
```
Filter candidates that match microRNA seed regions to reduce off-target effects.

**⚙️ High-Throughput Analysis**
```bash
nextflow run nextflow_pipeline/main.nf --gene_list genes.txt
```
Process hundreds of genes with containerized Nextflow pipeline.

**💊 Chemical Modifications**
```bash
sirnaforge workflow KRAS --modification-file examples/modification_patterns/fda_approved_onpattro.json
```
Track and apply FDA-approved modification patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

siRNAforge implements a modular pipeline designed for both interactive use and high-throughput automation:

```
Gene Symbol → Transcript Retrieval → siRNA Design → Off-target Analysis → Ranked Candidates
```

**Core Components:**
- **Gene Search** — Multi-database transcript retrieval (Ensembl, RefSeq, GENCODE)
- **Design Engine** — Thermodynamic scoring with ViennaRNA integration
- **Off-target Analysis** — BWA-MEM2 genome-wide alignment
- **Nextflow Pipeline** — Scalable containerized execution

📖 **[Architecture documentation →](docs/developer/architecture.md)**

---

## 🔬 System Requirements

### Docker Environment (Recommended)
All dependencies included in the image:
- Nextflow ≥25.04.0
- BWA-MEM2 ≥2.2.1
- SAMtools ≥1.19.2
- ViennaRNA ≥2.7.0
- Python 3.9-3.12

### Local Development
Python-only features work immediately. Off-target analysis requires Docker or manual installation of bioinformatics tools.
