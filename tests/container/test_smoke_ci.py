"""Ultra-minimal smoke tests for CI/CD with toy data.

These tests are designed to run extremely fast with minimal resources
to provide quick feedback in CI/CD pipelines while using toy data.

These tests work in two modes:
1. CI simulation mode: When sirnaforge CLI is not available, tests basic imports
2. Docker mode: When sirnaforge CLI is available, tests actual functionality
